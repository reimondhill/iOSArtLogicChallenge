# iOSArtLogicChallenge
**Artlogic Ramon** is a mobile apllication for iOS inspired by *Artlogic PrivateViews*. The app works on iOS13+ devices and it supports both iPhone and iPad portrait and landscape designs.

Artlogic Ramon allows the user to fetch collections and to discover the presentations. 

The app is coded using Swift 5 and with some of the latest version techniques such as *Result Types*, amongst others. In addition, the code is structured in a way that offers the possibilty to scale easily and to be tested simply using *MVVM*, *Dependency Injection* and *Protocol Oriented Programing*. 

The app also offers a starting set of both Unit and UI tests grouped within differnet Swift files with the possibilty to add more in the future for great *Continuos Integration*.

This demo version takes into consideration the required techniques and protocols as outlined in the brief, however the design has been modified to satify a modern and elegant one. To further develop this app I would consider an overlaping header in the PresentationViewController.
